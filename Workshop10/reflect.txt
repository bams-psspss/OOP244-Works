For the workshop 10, I think the template thing is quite complicated if we do not know what is going on ion the main or what is the purpose of that function. At frist I blindly do it without reading the main function, which I know I should have not done that, thenI struggle for few hours and decided to go back and read the main and then I realize it is a little more simple than I thought it would be (kind of). 

For milestone04, for now everything looks good and the program goes and it should go, I am now having difficult time with ms05.
